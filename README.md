This DataFetcher component fetches blog posts from an external API when the page loads.
While the data is being fetched, it shows a "Loading..." message, and if an error happens, it displays an error in red.
Once the data is successfully loaded, it displays a clean, styled list of post titles inside a nice card layout.
The component also includes simple CSS styling directly in the file to make the UI look neat and user-friendly.
